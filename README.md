# OpenMovies

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/mazylol/openmovies)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/mazylol/openmovies)

An opensource api for movies and in the future, tv.

There is a work in progress front end at https://openmovies.mazylol.com. You can call the api directly at `/api`

But keep in mind. Everything at `/api` proxies to https://openmovies.onrender.com

I am using the render free tier, so it will have a considerable startup time. But if this gets more popular, it should not be as bad, so tell your friends lol.

## Contributions
Very very very welcome. At the moment the main thing is content. Adding movies and their information would be greatly appreciated. There is also the website that needs more fleshed out at https://github.com/mazylol/openmovies-site.
